                Hi, I'm Annemarie.
            </h1>
            <p>
                I'm an East Coast native living it up in the beautiful PNW
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm a researcher / recruiter turned programmer
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h1>
                What am I up to?
            </h1>
            <p>
                I'm currently in the Flatiron Software Engineering bootcamp, where I'm re-tooling my skillset for my transition into the tech.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h1>
                Why the change?
            </h1>
            <p>
                I love learning new things and solving problems. Tech is a way for me to merge the enjoyment of helping people with greater creativity and autonomy.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h1>
                What inspires me?
            </h1>
            <p>
                In what other field is there such opportunity for <i>anyone</i> to bring new ideas to life that can change the world? 
                <br>
                <br>
                Whether that's how Airbnb disrupted how we travel, or how two freshman from Harvard built a website (over only three days!) in response to the crisis in Ukraine to link refugees with host volunteers across Europe. 
                <br>
                <br>
                That is incredible to me, and I want to be part of it.
